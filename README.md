# A Bit About Me

Hi, my name is Oyeyemi Odubela. I am based in New York. I enjoy using data to tell stories and gaining useful insights from it. In 2020, I began studying Data Analysis using self-paced online resources and personal projects, and then decided to pursue it further.

I hold a Masters Degree in Business Analytics from Fordham University, New York. I also earned my bachelors degree in 2014 from Covenant University, Nigeria in Marketing.

I have expertise with Tableau, SQL, Python and Microsoft Excel for data preparation, transformation, and visualization. I have the ability to convey information to end users in a way that is clear, effective, and valuable.

I am currently seeking new opportunities and collaborations; please feel free to contact me.
